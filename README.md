# date-parsing-simple-json-example

Almost nobody agrees on how dates should be handled in general, much less JSON. This repo provides an example of how you *might* handle dates in JSON.

Remember that parsing dates in JS is dependent on locale, so you should basically never trust anything related to dates. You have been warned.
